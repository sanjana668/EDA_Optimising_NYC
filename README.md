# EDA_Optimising_NYC
## Objective
This project demonstrates the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on the 2023 Yellow Taxi Trip Data from New York City. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that could help a taxi company improve its operations, customer service, and profitability in the dynamic urban environment of NYC.

# Business Context
Taxis are an essential part of NYC’s urban transportation network. With fluctuating demand patterns across locations and time periods, taxi service providers need to continuously analyze trip data to:
1. Optimize fleet management
2. Identify high-demand zones and hours
3. Improve driver dispatch strategies
4. Maximize revenue
5. Enhance passenger experience

As an analyst at a new taxi company entering the NYC market, this project simulates your task of analyzing real-world taxi trip data to identify trends, inefficiencies, and actionable business opportunities.

# Tools used
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization
4. Jupyter Notebook – Interactive data analysis

# Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis of NYC's 2023 yellow taxi trip data highlights the potential of data-driven strategies in optimizing taxi operations. By uncovering key patterns in ride volume, timing, location preferences, fare structures, and tipping behaviors, the project provides a foundational understanding for:

1. Enhancing fleet efficiency
2. Improving customer satisfaction
3. Increasing profitability
4. Making informed operational decisions

The insights derived from this analysis can empower new and existing taxi operators in NYC to better align their services with real-world demand patterns, ensuring both competitiveness and quality of service in a rapidly evolving urban mobility landscape.
